# Simple Age Calculator Using HTML, CSS, and JS

This project is a simple calculator that returns the current age of the person using the application.<br>
It requests the person's full date of birth and evaluates it using a function via the "Calculate" button.<br> 
It uses a script to calculate and evaluate the information.<br>
If the input is empty, it displays a message "Please enter a date" and returns to the beginning of the code block for the user to re-enter their data.<br>
Also, compare the script if the user has not yet turned 18 this year to return the exact age.<br>

Social media links have been added to the footer.<br>
